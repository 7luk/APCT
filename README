Hey there! Glad to see you. If you are seeing this , then you are also probably wondering "Another useless tool?!?"
Well... yes and no ... until we get there, let me introduce to you.
I'm a 14 year old teen that has a passion for computers, which also has a father that works in IT. 
Soooo , you might know the rest of the story. I like using the computer a lot(and when I say a lot i mean a lot) , a thing that my father doesn't really
like because he says it affects my life(kinda true :/ ), so there comes the most annoying thing. TIME RESTRICTIONS.

At first, it was easy, you know , like the windows 7 parental controls were kinda doing the job until i started developing my aptitudes.

In the beggining , i was just doing a net user from my account in an allowed period , changing my dads password... blah blah blah... you get the point
Meanwhile , my dad has been introduced to dedicated parental controls (Kaspersky Safe Kids and all those good shiz), and this is where the things started
getting complicated for the 10 year old me.
One day i discovered safe mode (the windows one and the android one too), which was allowing me to just remove the files(uninstall the frozen app on android)
you know, and this method worked fine until my dad found out and got rid of my admin permissions. It was a very sad day for me :(

After some time of "suffering"(yes i said suffering because if you are a computer-obsessed kid like me it really makes you feel bad to not own the power)
i found out how to replace utilman with cmd and regain admin rights for my user.

Some time passed until then, everything was going alright, UNTIL my dad encrypted the os drive. The sad feeling came back again..........

After some research and realizing that my computer was full of trash i decided trying something new. This is the moment i found out KALI LINUX
It was the best day of my life. Everything was running so smooth , there were no parental controls , i just learned to use wine so porting from windows didn't even feel like a loose.

But everything was running too good to be true ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
A few weeks passed by and my dad got a mikrotik router... AND started putting restrictions AGAIN(huh, life)

So yeah, there we are in the present ... a 14yo trying to bypass a simple parental control thing that ruins my life.
Meanwhile, im trying to decrypt a bitlocker encrypted drive and many other crazy experiments

The thing is that with APCT (Advanced Parental Control Toolkit) i want to not just win the "war" betwenn teens and parental controls ,BUT i want to create a powerful
tool that can do a lot of crazy stuff . The aproximate size for the first release is going to be maximum 1 gig(this is how crazy i expect it to be), but i am just at the beggining
so follow along if you want to see the story of (maybe) one of the best tools of the future

Im open to new ideas , questions, and requesting help with bypassing parental controls so feel free to ask by opening a new thread on this project's page

See you in the next update
Bye!
